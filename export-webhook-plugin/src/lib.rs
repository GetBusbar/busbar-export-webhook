//! The **request-log-webhook export sink as a droppable busbar plugin** — a `cdylib` that exports the neutral
//! six-symbol C ABI at `kind: export`. Build it, drop the resulting `.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib` into the
//! engine's plugins folder, and name it from an `export.<name>.module: request-log-webhook` config block; the
//! engine loads it in-process at boot.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately tiny: all the sink logic lives in the `busbar-export-webhook` `lib` crate. Here we
//! only adapt the engine's JSON config into a sink and hand the trait object to the SDK, which emits
//! the six extern-C symbols the loader resolves via [`busbar_plugin_sdk::export_export_plugin`].
//!
//! SCAFFOLD: [`open`] delegates to `busbar-export-webhook::open`, which reports `unimplemented` until the
//! byte-identical sink extraction from busbar-core lands (busbar 1.6.0 DECISIONS #3, oracle-gated).
