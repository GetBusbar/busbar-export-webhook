//! `GetBusbar/store-sqlite`'s `store-sqlite-plugin/tests/e2e.rs`).
//!
//! SCAFFOLD: the real over-the-ABI e2e lands with the sink extraction (an `unimplemented` `open`
//! has nothing to exercise across the loader yet). Kept as an ignored placeholder so the harness and
//! its `busbar-plugin-loader` dev-dependency are wired from day one.
